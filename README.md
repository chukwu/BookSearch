# Description:

Build a simple SPA that serves as a directory to browse for books and book reviews.

See http://idreambooks.com/ as an example - we want the same thing but with your own styles,

filters, search, and implemented using the rest APIs. Go to http://idreambooks.com/api to read

up on the documentation of the APIs they provide and to generate an API key to use in your

submission.

# Requirements:

- Use a style preprocessor

- Use bootstrap for responsive support

- Modularized approach, clean and commented code on all fronts (HTML, CSS & JS)

- Simple and intuitive navigation, search and filtering based on the data available from the APIs

- Animated transitions

- Must use GIT for version control

- Must not use an SPA framework, like AngularJS

The completed assignment should be hosted on a public URL (of your choosing) that we can

view.

Feel free to use any plugins, or any additional resources you use to achieve this are completely

up to you, as long as you can provide an explanation why you chose them.

Deliverables:

- Public link for the project

- GitHub link for the project
